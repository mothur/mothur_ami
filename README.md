# mothur_ami

Repository to create and maintain an Amazon AMI for mothur

In the meantime, an installation of mothur (along with R, QIIME, and a whole bunch of other bioinformatics tools) is located on the EDAMAME course (edamame-course.org) AMI which is publically available and can be found by searching for `EDAMAME-2015` or `ami-af04f2c4`.  [See this page for help](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/usingsharedamis-finding.html) on finding public AMIs

A mothur AMI is currently in the works.
